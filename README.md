# Sleight2
Fork of the Sleight project since the deprication of certbot-auto, a python script to automate the buildout of Empire C2 redirectors.
Sleight2 is a fork of Sleight and is in no way involved with or supported by the creators of Sleight.
You can view the original code here https://github.com/V1V1/Sleight

The goal of this project is to further develop the script so that it can create redirectors that can be used with any C2 infastructure. Currently it should work well with Empire and Covenant. The next goal is to configure it to work well with Cobalt Strike.
Once it is working with all three of these C2 programs I will begin to build in options for assisting with EDR/Defender evasion.
